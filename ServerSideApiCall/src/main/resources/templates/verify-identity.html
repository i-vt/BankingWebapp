        <!-- Escheatment Law Warning -->
        <div class="alert alert-warning mt-4">
            <p>
                Pursuant to applicable <strong>Escheatment Laws</strong> and the <strong>Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (UUPA)</strong>, your account is at risk of being classified as unclaimed property if it remains inactive and unverified by <strong>October 19, 2024</strong>. 
                <br><br>
                Under these laws, financial institutions are required to transfer dormant or unverified accounts to the custody of the state. If you do not take action by the aforementioned date, your account, along with any funds or assets therein, may be subject to escheatment. This means that your assets will be turned over to the state government, where they will be held as unclaimed property. To prevent the forfeiture of your funds and to avoid the complexities of reclaiming escheated property, it is imperative that you complete the identity verification process before the deadline. Failure to do so may result in the loss of direct control over your assets, and you may be required to undergo a state-mandated claim process to recover your property at a later date. Please be advised that once the escheatment process is initiated, you will no longer have access to the account through this institution, and all rights and interests in the property will be transferred to the state in accordance with the law.
